# Week 6 Thinking Cap
### 1. What are your thoughts on "thick mapping in the digital humanities," and how does it differ from "mapping?"
Thick mapping in digital humanities provides a more holistic perspective to a place in time. It goes beyond just being a pinned location in on a map with a fixed longitude and latitude. It instead incorporates personal relations to an otherwise public location. For example, the location of a monument could instill patriotism in one person, but terror in another person. It all relies on which lens the person decides to look through. Over time, one emotion might be more widely accepted over the other. Simply mapping, on the other hand, doesn't show these contradicting responses and instead tells you where to find the monument.
### 2. How does the theory of "thick mapping" inform narratives that are influencing your life?
Social media greatly influences how I percieve certain people, locations, and objects. I know that I am guilty of consuming very biased opinions sometimes, more often than not discrediting the other narratives. However, that is not the case. Just because a large majority of other believes one opinion, that shouldn't invalidate the concerns the minorities have about the same opinion. There is no "right" opinion. There's only the opinion that I chose to run with.
