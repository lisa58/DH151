        <i>Greetings, fellow web surfer!</i> I'm Labiba Alam. 
        Above is a picture of me and my rabbit's nose. I'm
        currently a senior at UCLA, majoring in <b>Bioengineering</b>
        with a technical breath in <b>Digital Humanities</b>. 
        I look forward to taking DGT HUM 151 with all of you this
        quarter! The only coding program that I'm familiar with is <b>MATLAB</b>, 
        but more specifically <b>Simulink</b> so I hope to
        branch out my skills to help me in my inevitable job searching quest!
    </p>
