## UX Design

# Reaction Piece
Prior to taking Digital Humanities for my technical breadth, I didn't know anything about UX Design so I found this article very informative for me because it gave me more insight about the field itself and gave me more of an idea as to whether or not I wanted a career in UX Design in the future. It made me realize how much I take certain websites for granted. It's much easier to notice a website that is hard to navigate through as opposed to one that is user friendly.
